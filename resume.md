## Projects/Projekter

### Operadocs 
[Link](https://operadocs.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/YesSeri/opera-docs)

This is a webpage where you can find sheet music for free for operas. Having worked as an opera singer for many years, I know how hard it can be to find the correct sheet music, quickly. All the scores I upload are no longer under copyright protection.

- Next.js
- MySQL
- Python

### Bubblewrap 
[Link](https://yesseri.github.io/bubblewrap.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/YesSeri/bubble-wrap)

A game written in Rust and Wasm. Survive the bubbles that attack you. Everything is written from scratch, no game engine or things like that. Wasm4 contains a set of basic functions such as painting rectangles and setting individual pixels to one of four chosen colors. Play with arrow keys and Z and X.

- Rust
- I made a wrapper game engine around wasm4

### Pianisto
[Link](https://pianisto.net/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/YesSeri/svelte-piano)

A piano that you can play online. It is written in Svelte and uses the Tone.js library. It was inspired by the piano app Real Piano. I wanted to create an ad-free alternative.

- CSS
- Javascript
